<p>The evolution continues. Don retired a second time in July. Holly married
Steve Gray last March, and Jenn and Eric are expecting a son in January.</p>
<p>Don retired from teaching when he went into law and has now retired from law
as well. This allows him more time to cook and sing. Don sings with the South
Coast Singers (same group, new name) and he enjoys the group and the music. They
sing five concerts in July and another five in December. Linda is still the
Director of Technology at Placentia Yorba Linda USD and she still loves her job.
She is still learning new things which makes working fun. In 2002, Linda got
caught up in the excitement of the Angels run and she and Don went to several
playoff games and the World Series. Don attended over 300 games in St. Louis as
a youngster and probably that many games in Anaheim and Los Angeles but had
never been to a playoff or World Series game before. We got to go to Game 2 of
the World Series and we had tickets for Game 7 but didn’t get to go because
Don had emergency surgery the day before. (It didn’t amount to much, just an
inconvenience.) Don continually updates the family home page and you can go
there for pictures and stories in more detail. The family web page is at </font>http://www.members.cox.net/dkslaw<font SIZE="2">.
(Please note the changed address)</p>
<p><img border="0" src="wedding11.jpg" align="left" width="288" height="216">&nbsp; Holly and Steve Gray
were married in March in a private ceremony in Hawaii. They are a handsome
couple, as you can see here. They have a beautiful home in San Clemente and are
planning to start a family soon. Because of all of those developments, Holly
decided not to go to nurses’ school and she is back at PeopleSoft part time.
Steve also works at PeopleSoft and he has already become an integral part of the
Smith clan. You can see more of their wedding pictures on the Smith Family web
site at </font>http://www.members.cox.net/dkslaw<font SIZE="2"> by clicking on
Holly &amp; Steve’s page.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Jeff and his family are still in Arizona and he manages an auto glass
business. He is really developing his business skills and is a very good
manager. Their son Fritz is growing rapidly and now plays basketball on the
Chino Valley HS team. Everyone is proud of him! Noah came to visit again and he
and Don and Linda went to Disneyland and California Adventure. He and Don went
to <b><img border="0" src="images/Europe%20with%20Jen/Copy_of_jendonbridge.jpg" align="right" width="360" height="239"></b>Sea World
and the beach in San Clemente while Linda worked. He is such a great kid! You
can see pictures of his 2002 visit by going to our website, clicking on Jeff
&amp; Shannon’s page and then going to Noah’s page. We can’t wait until
Logan is old enough to come visit too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Europe%20with%20Jen/prague11.jpg" align="left" width="216" height="288">&nbsp;&nbsp; Linda, Don, Jenn
and Eric visited Budapest and Prague (shown here) in March. Due to work
schedules, it was a short trip but a very enjoyable one. Both cities are just
beautiful and we would love to go back for a more extended visit. (However, Don
&amp; Linda are going to Scotland next spring.) Prague in particular is a great
&quot;walking city&quot;. There are many more pictures of Budapest and Prague on
our website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kelly, Marc, Michael and Maddie are still in San Clemente
and their home is really looking nice. Marc has worked his magic on the yard and
with his Dad’s help completely redid the kitchen. He still builds racecars for
a living and has taken up dirt biking. Kelly still works at PeopleSoft alongside
Holly and Steve. Michael continues to grow … he passed Grandpa a couple of
years ago. He is a very nice young man and has some very nice friends. His
passion now is skateboarding. Linda loves to take him to the movies and he
indulges her from time to time. Maddie will be five in March and will begin
kindergarten in the fall. Maddie went to Disneyland with Don and Linda and they
all had a fun time. She also came over and helped decorate the Christmas tree as
you can see by the first picture above. Check out the Disneyland trip by going
to our homepage, clicking on Kelly &amp; Marc’s page and then clicking on
&quot;Maddie’s Excellent Adventure.&quot;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="thankx11.jpg" align="right" width="216" height="162"></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before departing for Budapest and Prague, Jennifer and
Eric surprised us with the news that they were expecting a baby in January. When
the news came that the baby was to be a boy, they chose Elijah Kane for his
name. They were &quot;home&quot; for Thanksgiving and her sisters gave her a
very nice baby shower for friends and family. It was a great visit and Don got
to cook for the shower and for 23 guests for Thanksgiving. Nothing makes him
happier!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/Lopez/jenhouse11.jpg" align="left" width="216" height="144">&nbsp; Since our last
newsletter, Eric has a new job as the technology director for a company that
makes weapons for the US Army. It is the perfect job for an Army Veteran who
loves to play computer war games. Jenn works for a wonderful law firm, which
provides new Moms with a 3 month paid leave so she will be at home with Elijah
for three months after he arrives. With jobs they both love, the expectant
parents decided that purchasing a home was a good investment and their little
cottage was pretty small for three and the visitors they often have. Don has now
been out to NJ ten times since May 2001 and Linda has visited six times. Their
new 3-bedroom home is in immaculate condition with lots of improvements made by
the former owner. Don and Linda will be in NJ again for New Year’s Eve and
again when Elijah makes his appearance. It’s a safe bet that Don and Linda
will be there even more next year. Don has added pictures of Jenn in her
motherly condition and pictures of the house on the web page.</p>

<p>Kelly, Marc, Maddie and Michael joined us for a Christmas eve dinner. Linda’s
mom, Tobey, was with us too and Holly and Steve came by for dessert and the gift
exchange. It was an evening of good food and fun. This was the most incredible
‘gourmet’ dinner of the year.</p>
<p>We hope your 2003 is the best ever and that you enjoy good friends, family
and good health.</p>
