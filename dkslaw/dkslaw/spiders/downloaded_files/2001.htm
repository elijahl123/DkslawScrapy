Changes</span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> 
<img border="3" src="Jenngradpic.jpg" align="right" width="144" height="223"><o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Hello again from the
Smith Family!!<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Linda and Don are once
again “empty-nesters” and that took a little getting used to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Jennifer graduated from USC Law School in May and her husband Eric
graduated from DeVry Institute in June.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jenn
took a position as an attorney in Roseland, NJ and they moved there during the
summer. Eric quickly secured a position as a technology analyst for the Superior
Court system in Hackensack, so they are settling in to their new life. Don has
already been back to visit six times.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jenn and Eric returned to California for Thanksgiving and
Christmas, which made us very happy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Holly decided it was
time to have a place of her own and she moved to an apartment in San Clemente in
September.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We miss her, especially
when we go on walks, and Cassidy and Mugsy miss Ruby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But Ruby comes to visit sometimes which is nice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Holly and Mike broke up and she is now dating a very nice man named
Steve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She is set to begin
nurses’ training next spring so her life has seen many dramatic changes in
2001.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since she has been successful
in everything she has done, we know she will be an outstanding nurse as well. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The kids have moved
farther away and Linda has found work closer to home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although it was hard to leave a District she loved, one of our dear
friends, Peter Hartman, became ill and it was impossible to lend the type of
support she wanted to and work 70 miles away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A perfect position became available in a District with a great
Superintendent, so she applied and was very surprised when <a href="http://www.pylusd.k12.ca.us">Placentia-Yorba
Linda</a> offered her the job.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Her responsibilities now include all aspects of
technology support including networking, pc support and information services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It’s a steep learning curve, which means she is loving every minute.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It seems that in all the jobs she has had she loves the people she works
with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite the change, she and
Don were able to travel to New Jersey and Atlanta, but they missed Washington,
DC for the first time in several years. They hope to go to DC next February!&nbsp;
Because of Don’s frequent forays to visit Jenn and Eric, there was only one 
<a href="../SmithWeb05/Interests/TravelsHP/Europe01.htm">big
vacation trip</a> this year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Don,
Linda, Jenn and Eric set off for Ireland and Scotland in March but due to the
Foot &amp; Mouth disease problem, they ended up in Rome.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>It was great fun!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Kelly, Marc, Michael, and Maddie
bought a very nice home in San Clemente and they are busily fixing it to their
specifications.&nbsp; Marc's dad helped them put in a brand new kitchen and it
looks great!!!&nbsp; Kelly is still at Peoplesoft and she will probably be named
Presiden</span><span style="font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><img border="0" src="images/Jeff/jeffvisit.jpg" align="left" width="366" height="242"></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">happy
and easy to please, but is a normal three year old and can be a handful at
times.&nbsp; She visits her grandparents occasionally and they greatly enjoy
their time with her.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><o:p>

</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Don is practicing law
part time now, working as often as he wants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In addition to his cooking interests and his 1955 Ford F-150 pick-up, he
recently joined the Capistrano Chorale and is trying to learn enough about
Microsoft Front Page to edit our Home Page.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He’s done a wonderful job of making the pages faster to load and added
all our vacations plus this letter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally,
Don is trying to visit all <a href="../SmithWeb05/Interests/donsbaseball.htm">30 major league
ballparks</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Linda hopes
that if Don gets enough hobbies, he won’t bug her to retire early (in eight
years) and she can indulge her hobby, which is her job.&nbsp; <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Incidentally,
“Mug Wump”, (Mugsy’s formal name) means “one who aspires to great
heights” in Native American folklore.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">We
wish you the best year ever and invite you to visit if you can.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We now have a “guest suite” which includes a great
breakfast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Don’s sister
Judy and her daughter, Camile, and Jennifer and Eric have given it a &quot;10&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Keep in touch … we love hearing from you.<o:p>
