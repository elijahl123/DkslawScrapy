    <h3 align="center"><font size="3" face="Times">Welcome and greetings from the ever-expanding Smith clan.&nbsp; The year 2000 saw the birth of a new grandson, Logan Glen Smith, (born to Jeff and Shannon in October), the addition of a son-in-law, Eric Lopez (married to Jennifer in June), and our new pooch, Mugsy (short for Mug Wump), a 5 year old poodle we rescued from the animal shelter in December. She is lazy and prefers to sit in Don&#146;s lap.&nbsp; Cassidy is doing fine but has a little arthritis, so long walks are out for her.</font></h3>

		<p><font size="3" face="Times">Linda is starting her fifth year as Director of Technology for the San Bernardino School District, and she says she still doesn&#146;t mind the drive.&nbsp; Thank goodness for the Mission Viejo Library and Books on Tape!&nbsp; She now has a wonderful staff of 23 and new responsibilities including network administration and PC support, and she is still active in several organizations.&nbsp; As a result of her increased responsibilities, she and Don traveled to Seattle, Portland, Washington DC, Las Vegas, Santa Barbara and Palm Springs. She works and Don enjoys the sights. In addition, we went to New York, Montreal, Quebec and Toronto for vacation and to Prescott, AZ to visit Jeff and his family.&nbsp; We thoroughly enjoyed Canada and the tour of
        Niagara Falls was spectacular!&nbsp; Check our web site for pictures and notes.</font></p>

		<p><font size="3" face="Times">Jennifer will graduate from USC School of Law in May.&nbsp; Her husband Eric will graduate with a degree in computer science from DeVry Institute at the same time.&nbsp; Jenn accepted a wonderful offer from a law firm in New Jersey so they will be moving east next May.&nbsp; It&#146;s a great opportunity but we will certainly miss them!&nbsp; You can bet we will be using our frequent flyer miles going to New Jersey to visit.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3" face="Times">Kelly, Marc, Michael, and Maddie are still in San Clemente.&nbsp; Kelly is one of the driving forces behind the success at Peoplesoft.&nbsp; To show how insightful she is, she got them to hire Holly.&nbsp; Peoplesoft stock wouldn&#146;t be worth a nickel without them.&nbsp; Michael is now 12 and taller than we are.&nbsp; He is a fine student and a very good soccer player.&nbsp; But more importantly, he is a delight and a pleasure to talk with.&nbsp; Maddie is developing a sweet, radiant personality.&nbsp; She is so happy and so easy to please, she too is a treat to have around.&nbsp; Marc is still building racecars and now owns one of his own.&nbsp; Watch out Unser family ... here comes Garrison!</font></p>
		<p><font size="3" face="Times">Jeff and his family moved to Prescott, AZ this year.&nbsp; Shannon&#146;s parents and her sister live there and Jeff was able to get a good job so things are certainly looking up for them.&nbsp; Fritz is in middle school and Noah is in second grade.&nbsp;&nbsp; Noah is a very gifted reader and loves school.&nbsp; He is coming to visit on Dec. 26 and he will certainly show his Nana (Linda) all his newly acquired computer skills.&nbsp; We really enjoyed our visit in Prescott and Jeff and family have a very nice home there.</font></p>

		<p><font size="3" face="Times">Don continues to practice law in Santa Ana and San Bernardino.&nbsp;He has represented clients in 41 different courts in two states and 8 counties.&nbsp; He would rather cook special meals for family birthdays, Thanksgiving, Christmas and the Holiday
        Caroling than anything else.&nbsp; His kids bought him a chef&#146;s shirt with &quot;Chef Don&quot; on it for his birthday. This is our 13<sup>th</sup> year
        caroling and one of our favorite traditions. Don bought a &quot;tricked-out&quot; 1955 Ford pick-up and enjoys showing it off. Linda and Don celebrated their 25th anniversary in June and hope to travel even more in the next 25!!</font></p>

		<p><font size="3" face="Times">It was an exciting party! Holly went to work for Peoplesoft and she is doing great.&nbsp; Mike works for Edison but is applying for other jobs as he does not enjoy working inside.&nbsp;&nbsp; Holly&#146;s &quot;baby&quot; Ruby (her giant dog) is a sweetheart and they go on long walks twice a day.&nbsp; Don joins them for the evening walk.</font></p>
