<font face="Times New Roman,Times">... the last of the 90's.&nbsp; What a 
wonderful year!!</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Linda continues
the ancient So. California tradition of drive, drive and then drive some
more.&nbsp; Her job as the <font color="#1B1E39">

of Technology for the </a></font>
<a href="http://www.sbcusd.k12.ca.us/technology/index.html">San
Bernardino City Unified School District </a>has
expanded to include the network, computer repair and PC support in addition
to all instructional technology.&nbsp; But at least they didn't burden
her with higher pay.&nbsp; She now has a staff of 17 (up from 7) and she
is still doing presentations for various organizations.&nbsp; As a result
she and Don traveled to <font color="#1B1E39"> 
<a href="../SmithWeb05/Interests/TravelsHP/DC99.html">Washington DC</a></font><u>,</u> in February
and to San Antonio and Dallas in November.&nbsp; San Antonio was great
fun and not just because Don was born there.&nbsp; It really is a fun place
to visit . <font color="#1B1E39"> 
<a href="../SmithWeb05/Interests/TravelsHP/spain.html">Linda, Don and Jenn went to Spain from
Dec. 27 to Jan. 9</a></font>.&nbsp; Well Linda and Don did.&nbsp; Jenn returned
home after 7 days while we continued on to Southern Spain.&nbsp; In June
Don and Linda returned to their honeymoon hotel <font color="#1B1E39"> 
<a href="../SmithWeb05/Interests/TravelsHP/Riverside.html">(the
Riverside Mission Inn) </a> </font>for their 24th wedding anniversary.&nbsp; It
is a beautiful hotel and close enough so Linda could return to work in
the afternoon!!!&nbsp; Our second annual summer trip to Las <font color="#1B1E39">
<a href="../SmithWeb05/Interests/TravelsHP/vegas1.html">Vegas </a></font>was
great as usual.</b></font>
<p><b>&nbsp;Jennifer
is in her second year of law at USC.&nbsp; She worked as a research librarian
at the law school library this year and next summer she will intern with
a law firm in downtown LA.&nbsp; It's pretty exciting as she is actually
getting paid for the skills she's acquiring.&nbsp; <font color="#1B1E39"> 
<a href="../SmithWeb05/Family%20Members/JenniferHP/lopez.htm">She
will be married next summer (June 24, 2000) to Eric Lopez,</a></font> a young
man she met two summers ago at her summer law firm job.&nbsp; Eric is studying
computer science at DeVry Institute and will graduate the same time Jenn
finishes law school.&nbsp; We are happy for both of them and Eric is already
a welcome addition to the family.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;Don
continues to practice law in Santa Ana.&nbsp; Law is now his 2nd longest
running career.&nbsp; He was a private investigator (5 years), youth and
music minister (3.5 years), school teacher (23 years) and has now been
a lawyer for 8 years.&nbsp; He still loves to cook the special meals for
family birthdays, Thanksgiving, Christmas and the Holiday Sing</b><p><b><font color="#1B1E39">

</font>This year 28 friends&nbsp; joined us for our 11th annual Holiday Sing.&nbsp;
Pictured are Don and Gladys Powell, Roger Yule, Don, Carole Wong, Pete
Hartman, Cal Burt, Jenn, Ed Wong, Kathy Yule, Mary Ann Olsen, Beth Hartman,
Melissa, Phyllis and Sunny Hartman on the piano.&nbsp; We were especially
pleased to see Don's sister Gladys and her family.&nbsp; The kids surprised
Don with a chafing dish&nbsp;<img SRC="images/Don-Linda/Donxmas.jpg" BORDER=0 height=208 width=286 align=LEFT>for
Christmas so he can cook for even larger crowds.</b>
<p><b><font color="#1B1E39">
<a href="../SmithWeb05/Family%20Members/Kelly%20&%20Marc/garr.html">Kelly,
Michael, Maddie and Marc</a></font> still live in San Clemente.&nbsp; Michael
is an exceptional soccer player and he is growing up fast.&nbsp; He is
tall, obviously not having the Smith gene.&nbsp; He is doing well in school
too.&nbsp; Maddie (21 months) is a sweetheart, a very happy little girl.&nbsp;
They were all here for the Holiday Sing too and it was fun to see Maddie
play with her cousins from San Diego.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kelly continues her exceptionally
busy job at Peoplesoft, where she recently received a promotion and Marc
is still building race cars but he admits he would rather be driving them.</b>
<p><b>Holly
and her "significant other," Mike, still live with us and both of them
are graduating from Cal State Long Beach in June.&nbsp; Holly is planning
to continue her schooling by getting her MFA in Literature.&nbsp; She wants
to be a writer and she is extremely talented.&nbsp; One of her stories
was published in the school's anthology and she was chosen to edit the
publication next semester. She got a new dog <font color="#1B1E39"> 
<a href="Our%20Pets.htm">(Ruby)</a></font>
who is part German Shepard and part others (maybe Great Dane) and Holly
takes her for long walks twice a day.&nbsp; <font color="#1B1E39"> 
<a href="Our%20Pets.htm">Scooter
and Cassidy </a></font>are 11+ so they don't do much walking anymore.&nbsp; Don
and Linda are hoping it will be a long time before Mike and Holly grow
up and leave home.</b>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;Jeff
and his wife and their boys live in Oxnard.&nbsp; Fritz continues to play
baseball and is doing very well in school.&nbsp; Noah is six and now in
first grade.&nbsp; He is a very gifted student and he loves school.&nbsp;
He and Linda (his Nana) love to play on the computer and Noah figures out
puzzles and games very quickly.&nbsp; We still don't see Jeff and his family
much because they live too far away and Jeff works most weekends.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;Linda
and Don still enjoy vacationing and exercising together.&nbsp; They joined
the "Y" and started playing racquetball and promptly got sick.&nbsp; (Exercise
makes a lot of people sick)&nbsp; They then switched to swimming and walking
on the treadmill, but finding time is still problematic.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;Have
a wonderful year 2000 and do call, snail mail or e mail us a note so we
can keep in touch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are always welcome to visit as
nothing gives us pleasure like seeing friends and family.</font></b>
